		<h1 class="clear">The Apps I Use</h1>
		<h2>Coderunner</h2>
		<p>Programming requires a good app to be able to be productive. Hence, I use CodeRunner. It is hands down one of the best code editors I've ever seen, being able to edit in over 200 languages, having full control over what you see, having a built-in console, having tons of library like node.js built in and others. This includes being able to code in Python, Markdown, HTML, PHP, Javascript, C#, Applescript, \(\LaTeX\) and so much more languages.</p>

		<h2>Davinci Resolve</h2>
		<p>Davinci resolve is a video editor famous for industry-leading color grading effects. It has especially powerful colour correction and audio capabilities. It comes with an 8k video editor, a VFX animation creator that is capable of 3D, an audio productor that can compete with Logic Pro X, a color grader that is among the best, free or paid, and a wide range of media formats. Also, it's all free. In my opinion, it's the best free video editor, being able to compete and overthrow other paid editors like Final Cut Pro X and Adobe Premiere Pro.</p>

		<h2>Musescore</h2>
		Musescore is a sheet music creator, mostly for classical music compositions. It comes with a set of instruments, notes, objects and much more. Every element is fully customizable, and there are rarely any bugs, other than the one where you can't paste into a compressed rest or else it crashes. Other than that, you can customize the audio and make it sound like a hall or a room, you can have full control over every instrument and their sound, you have full control over the soundfonts you use, and other things that are essential to a classical musician.

		<h2>Microsoft 365</h2>
		<p>Microsoft 365 is a suite designed by Microsoft to create documents, spreadsheets, presents and more. Here are the ones I use.
		<br>
		 Microsoft Word is part of the Microsoft 365 suite. This app is really powerful, in fact, it is one of the most powerful WYSIWYG editors. There is advanced math tools, advaned captioning and referencing, table of contents, tons of templates and much more.
		<br>
			Powerpoint is a really powerful presentation software, being able to create advanced animations, maths, layouts, fonts, and you insert code and even write scripts. People have pushed the limits of powerpoint, being able to create so much things, not just presentations. Just look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjxe8ShM-8">this</a>.

		<h1>Minecraft</h1>
		<h2>What is minecraft?</h2>
		<p>(From wikipedia) Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios. Created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language and released as a public alpha for personal computers in 2009, the game was officially released in November 2011, with Jens Bergensten taking over development around then. Minecraft has since been ported to various platforms and become the best-selling video game of all time, with 200 million copies sold across all platforms and 126 million monthly active users as of 2020.
		<br>
			In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally-generated 3D world with infinite terrain, and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures or earthworks. Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled "mobs", as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources. Players can modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.
		<br>
			Minecraft has been critically acclaimed, winning several awards and being cited as one of the greatest and most influential video games of all time, being inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame in June 2020. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual MineCon conventions played large roles in popularizing the game. It has also been used in educational environments, especially in the realm of computing systems, as virtual computers and hardware devices have been built in it. In 2014, Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property were purchased by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion. A number of spin-off games have also been produced, such as Minecraft: Story Mode, Minecraft Dungeons, and Minecraft Earth.</p>

		<h2>Why I like Minecraft</h2>
		<h3>Servers</h3>
		Minecraft is one of the rare games where although it's simple and blocks, it can be made into something great. Just look at the Minecraft server, Hypixel. It has a regular 60,000 players playing on it, with more than 50 mini-games custom coded with Java. These gamemodes are maintained through something called plugins.
		<h3>Freedom</h3>
		Another reason I like minecraft is how many different ways you can play it. You can be a vanilla player. You can be a server owner. You can be a hacker, a redstoner, a builder, a PVP'er, a speedrunner, a casual survival player, a modded survival player, an adventurer, you want more? You can be a plugin developer, you can be a mod developer, you can be a troll, an animator, a command block engineer, a cave explorer, a miner, a roleplayer, a multiplayer SMP player, a parkourer, a dropper player, a competitive player, a gamemode developer, an experimenter, a game mechanics researcher, a redstone compactor, the theoretical player, the player that makes piston doors and only piston doors, the player that makes flying machines and only flying machines, the computational player that always have a background of engineering, the seed finder, the factions player, the command block enthusiast, and <i>much more</i>!
		<h2 class="clear">Learning about the real world</h2>
		<img style="float:left;border:0; text-decoration:none; outline:none" width=440 height=346.5 src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/S8lI91KQHXRThkTPw88vSxZ7SJ7b-Xcgk4mFzOPXw4guJMMn_I1_DdcMFRtA_-oJrAr8eirdiqAWGe-cUwVEVSleQpkDdtzVA6aWFDsHrZV4ZlbFC-nveg">
		<p>While this is indeed a video game, a lot of the game mechanics are similar to the real world. From Minecraft, you learn that sand is used to smelt glass using a furnace. Metal comes from ores. Minecraft is educational because it enhances creativity, problem-solving, self-direction, collaboration, and other life skills. In the classroom, Minecraft complements reading, writing, math, and even history learnings. Importantly, Minecraft also instills business principles, STEM knowledge, and a global perspective. One mom, Michelle Conaway, has written multiple blog posts on the benefits she’s seen from her children playing Minecraft, especially in the most basic skill sets that one will need.<br>Since multiplayer heavily relies on the chat, one will have the will to use it a lot, and hence learn a lot about how people talk to each other.
		Michelle says, “I’ve seen kids figure out how many minutes they have until ‘night time’, average the amount of food needed to go on a mining adventure, divide supplies evenly among players, and estimate the area needed to build a city, the math concepts are all around them and they can’t help but learn them if they want to be successful at their game.”

		Michelle’s youngest child even asked her to give him quiz cards about multiplication, which is something he'd never done before. According to michelle, “He got every one of them correct—without ever doing worksheets or working from a textbook."<br>
		One school uses Minecraft as a virtual tour. They built a replica of historic places like the great pyramid or the eiffel tower, and they let the students download the map and take a look. This hugely replaces difficult memorization and worksheets, instead, one can view the architecture deeper than ever. Did you know that someone made a 3d grapher in Minecraft? Did you know that someone made a working phone in Minecraft? Did you know that someone made a working python code editor inside Minecraft? See, you actually learn in Minecraft.</p>
		<h3>Leadership skills</h3>By hosting a Minecraft server, you commit to: keeping up the hardware, making sure you have the latest version of everything, being able to deal with negativity, be creative in marketing, sell things at a reasonable price, provide active support for players, be able to handle lots of pressure, be able to keep up all the mods in the right version, and much more. Now, think about it: Isn't this what someone gets paid for in real life?
		<h3>STEM</h3>
		Now, by playing Minecraft, you can learn so much about hardware. From the F3 screen telling you so much stuff, you know how to do JSON coding, the fundamentals of java and more. If you want to mod, you have to code. If you want to create a datapack, you have to code. Not just that, you learn so much about math. Is the building off-center? How wide do I have to make that section of the house? Getting great knowledge of these STEM topics like science, technology, engineering and math is vital to live in the 21th century. Soon later, coding will become the new literature.
		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		By playing Minecraft, a lot of people have great lots of fun, without even realizing that they're learning essential skills and qualities to prepare for the real world in the future. If you haven't played Minecraft before, just sit down and watch someone who plays it. Understand what they're learning. It's not a waste of time just because it's a video game.
